My first step in the video game development. 
The purpose of this project was to discover the differents aspects of a video games.
<!--more-->

The game has been made with C++ and SFML, the map editor with C# and WinForm.
I have made a simple AABB collision physics engine, that allowed me to move a character on the map and fire bullets on enemies.
I have also made a simple interface to manage graphics settings.
It was possible to make a whole map in the editor (including custom trigger) and load it in the game.
