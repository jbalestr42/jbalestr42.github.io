My first intention was to grow some trees and L-System are well known for that.<br/>
You can find a lot of examples [here]({{ site.data.links.paullsystem }}).

{% include text.html text="
Making a tree with L-System is quite simple, but it becomes a way more tricky when you want to interpolate between each iteration.<br/>
There are only 4 examples in the demo but it's quite easy to create more tree by modifying the L-System's rules.
