What if every single one of us had a little creature - let's call it a cute digital clone - here to do all your chores? Wouldn't that be awesome?<br/>
Well, unfortunately, that's not (yet) possible.
<br/><br/>
What is possible though is to create your unique avatar, choose a mood, film 8 seconds of your unique life and share it with your amazing friends!
This is Kouji and it's a new way to communicate with your friends or create awesome content for your precious Instagram profile.
