This project was made at the school [42]({{ site.data.links.ft }}) with C.<br/>
In three weeks every student had to use the [ray casting technique]({{ site.data.links.raycasting }}) to generate a 3D map like the famous [Wolfenstein]({{ site.data.links.wolfenstein }}).<br/>
Only one function was provided : SetPixel(x, y, color).

In my own version I have implemented collisions, animated sprites, and a custom event system to trigger special visual effects.
