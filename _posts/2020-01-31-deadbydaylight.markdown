When I started to work on [Dead by Daylight]({{ site.data.links.dbd }}) I have been assigned in the Nintendo Switch team.<br/>
Then, I joined the core team and I had to work with all available platforms, PS4, Xbox, Steam.<br/>
You can read more about the switch release [here]({{ site.data.links.dbd }})
