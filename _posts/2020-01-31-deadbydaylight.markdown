When I started to work on [Dead by Daylight]({{ site.data.links.dbd }}) I have been assigned to work on the Nintendo Switch (more info [here]({{ site.data.links.switch_post }})).<br/>
Then, I had to work with all other available platforms, PS4, Xbox, Steam.<br/>

{% include text.html text="
I spent most of the time working on the party management system.<br/>
It was totally new to me, but I took up the challenge and I'm really proud about what I have accomplished with my team.<br/>
I learn a lot during this project and I met a really nice and dedicated team.<br/>
That was one of the most rewarding job I did both technically and relationally.<br/>
