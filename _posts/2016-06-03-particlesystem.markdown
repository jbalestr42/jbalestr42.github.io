This project is an introduction to parallel computing using OpenGL and OpenCL
<!--more-->
This project was made at 42 School with C, OpenCL and OpenGL.
It shows millions of particle moving around. The computation is done on the GPU with OpenCL, and the display is done with OpenGL. Both API are designed to interoperate, they share the particles data to avoid overheads.
