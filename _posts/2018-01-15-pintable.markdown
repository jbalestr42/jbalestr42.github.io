My own implementation of the "Pin Table".<br/>
The idea came by looking at the site [Game Art Tricks]({{ site.data.links.gameart }}) from [Simon Schreibt]({{ site.data.links.simonschreibt }}).

{% include text.html text="
I choose to generate the mesh procedurally in order to tweak multiples parameters to have the best result.<br/>
I also implemented transitions to change the scene with a custom effect.<br/>
The code can be improved in many way but the intention was to learn new things and have fun :D
