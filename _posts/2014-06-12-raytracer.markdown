This project was made at the school 42 with C.<br/>
In two weeks every student had to use the ray tracing technique to generate 3D images, followed by a month with a team of four people.<br/>
Only one function was provided : SetPixel(x, y, color).

Those videos are the result of 4 peoples, implementing all basic shapes (planes, cubes, sphere, cones), lights (specular, diffuse, multiple), reflection and refraction.<br/>
It's a CPU program and those videos are not in real time.
