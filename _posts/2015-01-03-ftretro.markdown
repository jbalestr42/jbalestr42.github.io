Small game made at 42 school. Two days of work with C++ and Ncurse.
<!--more-->
Born during a weekend, Ft Retro was created at the school 42 with C++ and Ncurses. As simple as it looks, it was a great challenge to create a small schmup in two days. It's built from scratch, including basic game logic, ASCII animated sprite display, collisions, movements, enemies, planets and power up.
